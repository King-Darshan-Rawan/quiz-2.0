# Quiz 2.0

Welcome to Quiz 2.0! This is a simple interactive quiz application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

Quiz 2.0 presents users with multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback on their answers. If the selected option is correct, it appears green, and the score increases by 1. If the selected option is incorrect, it appears red, but there's no negative marking.

The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
